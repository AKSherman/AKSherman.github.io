                <h3>SQL Data Exploration of Worldwide COVID Data from 2020-2021 </h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I explored global COVID-19 data to derive insights on infection and mortality rates, along with vaccination progress across different countries and continents. Using SQL, I worked with two datasets: one focused on COVID-19 cases and deaths, and another on vaccinations. Key tasks included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzing Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Calculated the death percentage relative to total cases across various locations, focusing on regions like the United States.</li>
                        <li>Infection Rates by Population: Identified countries with the highest COVID-19 infection rates by comparing total cases to population size.</li>
                        <li>Mortality Insights: Analyzed the countries and continents with the highest death counts and calculated the death rate by population.</li>
                        <li>Vaccination Analysis: Joined vaccination data with COVID case data to calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated and tracked the progress over time.</li>
                        <li>Visualization Preparation: Created views for key metrics such as the highest infection rates, death counts, and vaccination rates to facilitate future data visualization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These analyses provided a detailed understanding of the pandemic's impact globally and helped uncover key trends in infection and mortality rates, as well as vaccination rollout.

                <h3>COVID-19 Data from 2020-2021 Visualization with Tableau</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights from the COVID-19 pandemic using data derived from SQL queries. The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, and deaths across various countries and continents.
                    The Tableau dashboard effectively illustrates the significant trends of the pandemic and offers an intuitive way to explore how different countries and continents fared in terms of infection rates, mortality, and vaccination efforts.

                <p>
                    I plan on adding some projects using python but for now please check out my github for some of my Jupyter Notebooks of homework and projects from University where I used python for data mining and analysis.
                    Thank you
